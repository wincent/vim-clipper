INTRO                                                           *clipper-intro*

    "clipper (noun)
    an instrument for cutting or trimming small pieces off things."

                                                             *clipper-features*
vim-clipper provides integration between Vim and Clipper
(https://github.com/wincent/clipper), which is an macOS "launch agent" that
runs in the background providing a service that exposes the local clipboard to
tmux sessions and other processes running both locally and remotely.

Specifically, vim-clipper provides a |:Clip| command, to send the last-yanked
text to Clipper, it sets up a <leader>y mapping that calls |:Clip|.
Additionally, if the |TextYankPost| |autocommand| is available, it will send
the last-yanked text to Clipper automatically.


INSTALLATION                                             *clipper-installation*

To install vim-clipper, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and that
you want to install vim-clipper into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with: >

  git clone https://github.com/wincent/vim-clipper.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-clipper

Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject: >

  git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/vim-clipper.git ~/vim/bundle/vim-clipper
  git submodule init

To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with: >

  :call pathogen#helptags()


COMMANDS                                                     *clipper-commands*

                                                                        *:Clip*
:Clip       Sends the last-yanked text to Clipper.


OPTIONS                                                       *clipper-options*

                                                             *g:ClipperAddress*
  |g:ClipperAddress|                                string (default: localhost)

  Specifies the address at which to connect to the Clipper daemon. To override
  from the default of "localhost", set it in your |.vimrc|. The main reason
  you would want to do this is to make Clipper connect to a UNIX domain
  socket: >

    let g:ClipperAddress=~/.clipper.sock
<
  Note that if you want to connect using a UNIX domain socket, you must also
  set |g:ClipperPort| to 0.

  If |g:ClipperAddress| and |g:ClipperPort| provide insufficient
  configurability (for example, because you are using a version of `nc` that
  doesn't support UNIX sockets and want to use an alternative like
  `socat - UNIX-CLIENT:$SOCKET`), then you can use |clipper#set_invocation()|
  to provide an entirely custom string.

                                                                *g:ClipperPort*
  |g:ClipperPort|                                        number (default: 8377)

  Specifies the port on which to connect to the Clipper daemon. To override
  from the default of port 8377, set it in your |.vimrc|: >

    let g:ClipperPort=31337
<
  To connect via a UNIX domain socket, set the port number to 0, and provide
  the path to the socket using the |g:ClipperAddress| option.

  If |g:ClipperAddress| and |g:ClipperPort| provide insufficient
  configurability (for example, because you are using a version of `nc` that
  doesn't support UNIX sockets and want to use an alternative like
  `socat - UNIX-CLIENT:$SOCKET`), then you can use |clipper#set_invocation()|
  to provide an entirely custom string.

                                                                *g:ClipperAuto*
  |g:ClipperAuto|                                          boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to use the |TextYankPost| autocommand to route yanked text
  to Clipper automatically. To prevent this, set to 0 in your |.vimrc|: >

    let g:ClipperAuto=0
<
                                                                 *g:ClipperMap*
  |g:ClipperMap|                                           boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to set up the |<Plug>(ClipperClip)| mapping. To prevent any
  mapping from being configured, set to 0 in your |.vimrc|: >

    let g:ClipperMap=0
<
                                                              *g:ClipperLoaded*
  |g:Clipper|                                                  any (no default)

  To prevent vim-clipper from being loaded, set |g:ClipperLoaded| to any value
  in your |.vimrc|. For example: >

    let g:ClipperLoaded=1


FUNCTIONS                                                   *clipper-functions*


  |clipper#set_invocation()|                         *clipper#set_invocation()*

  Provide a completely custom string to invoke an arbitrary executable with
  arguments. This overrides the automatic invocation that would usually be
  created using `nc` and the values of |g:ClipperAddress| and |g:ClipperPort|.
  This may be necessary in environments where you want to use a UNIX domain
  socket but the local version of `nc` does not support the `-U` switch. For
  example: >

    call clipper#set_invocation('socat - UNIX-CLIENT:/path/to/socket')
<
  Note: This is a function and not a setting for security reasons; only the
  first call to |clipper#set_invocation()| will have any effect. In this way,
  you can place the call near the start of your |vimrc| without having to
  worry that a malicious plug-in will later overwrite it with something
  nefarious (important because whatever is passed to this function will be
  blindly executed with the |system()| function).

  As such, even if you don't want to use this feature, it is a good
  idea to lock it down by calling `clipper#set_invocation('')` in your
  |vimrc|.


MAPPINGS                                                     *clipper-mappings*

                                                            *<Plug>ClipperClip*
                                                          *<Plug>(ClipperClip)*
vim-clipper maps <leader>y to |<Plug>(ClipperClip)|, which sends the last-yanked
text to Clipper. To use an alternative mapping instead, create a different one
in your |.vimrc| instead using |:nmap|: >

  " Instead of <leader>y, use <leader>x.
  nmap <leader>x <Plug>(ClipperClip)

Note that vim-clipper will not try to set up its <leader>y mapping if any of
the following are true:

- A mapping for <leader>y already exists.
- An alternative mapping for |<Plug>(ClipperClip)| has already been set up from
  a |.vimrc|.
- The mapping has been suppressed by setting |g:ClipperMap| to 1 in your
  |.vimrc|.
